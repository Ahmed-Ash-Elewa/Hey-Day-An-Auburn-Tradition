Hey Day Interactive Script 
About Hey Day

Hey Day is a beloved tradition at Auburn University that began in 1947 to create a welcoming environment for returning World War II soldiers. The tradition involves handing out nametags to students, faculty, and staff, and encouraging them to say ‚Äúhey‚Äù to each other.

Over the years, Hey Day has grown to include free food, live entertainment, and events hosted by campus groups. The 78th Hey Day will be held on October 15, 2025, and will include live music, food, a pep rally, and other activities.
